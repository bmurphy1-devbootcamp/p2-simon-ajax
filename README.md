=============

This challenge was to dd jQuery to the provided Sinatra Shell for a simple Simon Says game. Each new color is added after the user clicks the "Click Me' button.

Modify the shell code to implement the following functionality:

* Clicking on the 'Click Me' button submits an AJAX request to the '/colors' route
* return a JSON object the server with a random color and cell number
* change the background color of the cell number returned to the color - WITHOUT MODIFYING THE HTML
